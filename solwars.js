// This file has been replaced with a properly structured web application
// The code has been reorganized into separate files:
// - index.html: Contains the HTML structure
// - styles.css: Contains all styling
// - script.js: Contains all JavaScript functionality

// The game has been updated with a Star Wars theme:
// - Black and yellow color scheme
// - Star Wars-themed locations (Coruscant, Tatooine, etc.)
// - Star Wars-themed tokens (KYBER, BANTHA, etc.)
// - Added a Star Wars intro crawl describing the game

// To run the game, open index.html in your browser

/*
Original code was jumbled with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript mixed together.
The new structure separates concerns:
- HTML in index.html
- CSS in styles.css
- JavaScript in script.js

The Star Wars theme includes:
1. A crawling text intro like the Star Wars movies
2. Black background with yellow accents (Star Wars colors)
3. Renamed locations to Star Wars planets
4. Renamed tokens to Star Wars items
5. Changed "SOL" to "CR" (Credits)
6. Changed "Day" to "Cycle"
7. Changed "Debt" section to "Hutt Loans"
